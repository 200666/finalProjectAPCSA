PROJECT TITLE: Snake Game APCSA
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: Demonstrate my knowledge of Java and multi-dimensional programming, while also expanding to new libraries I have never used before (such as Swing). I also wanted to apply this knowledge to the new context of Graphic User Interface
VERSION or DATE: June 3rd, 2019
HOW TO START THIS PROJECT: Drag all files to new project, but only run the RunSnake class. Make sure all images are also added to the main folder without any name changes. 
AUTHORS: Mia Ellis-Einhorn
USER INSTRUCTIONS: Hello, user! Get excited about this snake game. I intended to create a fun, interactive game that could be played by anyone, ages 0-100. This is a single player game.
